<em>My name is Ari Yao. I live in Chicago, IL. I love reading (mostly fantasy), dancing, and telling/writing stories. I have a lot of favorite books, so here are a few: <a href="http://www.worldofjohnflanagan.com/rangers-apprentice/">Ranger's Apprentice</a>, Dragonriders of Pern, Pit Dragon Chronicles, and <a href="http://www.mysteriousbenedictsociety.com/">The Mysterious Benedict Society.</a>
I also like drawing in my free time, especially <strong>dragons</strong>.</em>

The website that I am interested in building would be about books (and dragons). On the first page, you could post book summaries/reviews/recommendations, which would be separated into genres, for other people to read. On the second page, you could post your favorite book quotes. The third page would be for dragon lovers. You would be able to talk about dragon books and take pictures of dragon art or anything DRAGON. On the fourth and final page, someone could start a story, which would then be continued by someone else and so on. You would be able to add your own paragraph (at the minimum) to bring the story to life.
